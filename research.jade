						p The Broaders Lab is focused on learning more about how living cells sense and respond to their surroundings. Particularly, research is focused on disecting the ways that cells respond to the shape and chemical nature of their underlying substrata. How do these responses change between cells in isolation and cells acting as a tissue? The Broaders lab uses chemical tools to prepare precisely controlled environments that will help to answer these questions. The lessons learned from this research may reveal new insight into how multicellular organisms develop and help us to understand the rules for how cells sense, interact with, and respond to their material world.
