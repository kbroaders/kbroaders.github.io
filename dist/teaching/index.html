					Alternative Grading Tools
				</h1>
				<p>
					A repository for teaching materials I use for classes with alternative grading. Even if they cannot be directly used in your teaching, I hope that they can provide inspiration or a starting point for your own alternative grading journey.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please direct questions, concerns, or suggestions to Kyle Broaders (<a href="mailto:broaders@mtholyoke.edu">broaders@mtholyoke.edu</a>).

					Gradebooks
				</h2>
				<p>
					Below are example Google Sheets that I have used to implement mastery- and labor-based grade record-keeping and sharing. Suggestions for use are embedded in the <code>Instructions</code> sheet. Use them directly or as a starting point for building your own system.
				</p>
				<p>
					An important caveat for the sharing features of these gradebooks is that they require your students to have Google accounts. For security reasons, I would only recommend sharing using this system if your campus has an instutitional Google Workspaces.

Making individual sheets for each student within the document gives an overview of each student and supports sharing with students via an <code>IMPORTRANGE</code> statement in a separate spreadsheet document. Instructions are in the first sheet.

						<strong style="color:rgb(0, 116, 249)">Note:</strong> Hand-duplicating a copy of the <code>Template</code> sheet for each student is reasonable for small classes, but becomes onerous with larger classes. There is a script under Extensions â†’ Apps Script that can duplicate within the instructor sheet as well as making the individual spreadsheets with the appropriate <code>IMPORTRANGE()</code> statement.

I recommend reading the script (<a href="https://github.com/kbroaders/Google-Sheets-Gradebooks">also available on Github</a>) to make sure you know what it does before running anything. For most users, the only functions to execute are <code>makeStudentSheets()</code> and <code>makeIndividualSpreadsheets()</code>.

					My class schedules are built using Google Sheets so that they can exist as a living document as the semester develops. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nLXPYUkt6kPTvdYbmLGj5pk3rlHsvSB948gAIV_Aur4/edit?usp=sharing">My own template</a> contains the schedule, a reminder of learning goals, and a plot of the timing of quizzes.<br>

				<p>
					I find it helpful for buy-in and class morale to tell the story of how grades have tended to develop in previous semesters. I use this notebook to generate heatmaps showing how grades build over time. Tallies M grades in a spreadsheet that shares formatting with the <code>AllGrades</code> sheet, and displays them as a heatmap. Made for Julia in a Pluto notebook and available along with instructions for use and example data on <a href="https://github.com/kbroaders/Mastery-Grading-Progress">Github</a>.
