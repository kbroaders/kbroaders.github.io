				<h1>Alternative Grading Tools</h1>

					A temporary repository for teaching materials I use for classes with alternative grading.

					My class schedules are built using Google Sheets so that they can exist as a living document as the semester develops. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nLXPYUkt6kPTvdYbmLGj5pk3rlHsvSB948gAIV_Aur4/edit?usp=sharing">My own template</a> contains the schedule, a reminder of learning goals, and a plot of the timing of quizzes.<br>

					Below are example Google Sheets that I have used to implement mastery- and labor-based grade record-keeping and sharing. Suggestions for use are embedded in the <code>Instructions</code> sheet. Use them directly or as a starting point for building your own system.<br>
					<h3>Mastery Grading</h3>
					
					<p><img src="mastery-grading-schematic.png" style="width:100%"><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w2BBfDVhZ8lqioZywGdwvWosFGyseLR6Q-bUta7AXas/edit?usp=sharing">Mastery grading with example data</a>. If you want to build your own, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JuENKyCuAT1H5-eHjFshmJVR4lm9cxWDYfDVJyBSZaQ/edit?usp=sharing">here is a mostly blank version</a> with student sheets and example data deleted.
				</p>
				<h3>Labor-Based Grading</h3>
				<p>

If you want to build your own version, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gYwCTkgANgMBpqEOQTutxOLCj_4qFrDqNj9INxszYMg/edit?usp=sharing">here is a mostly blank version</a> with student sheets and example data deleted.

						Hand-duplicating a copy of the <code>Template</code> sheet for each student is reasonable for small classes, but becomes onerous with larger classes. There is a script under Extensions â†’ Google Apps Script that can duplicate within the instructor sheet as well as making the individual spreadsheets with the appropriate <code>IMPORTRANGE()</code> statement.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						Exercise caution executing scripts! I recommend reading the script (<a href="https://github.com/kbroaders/Google-Sheets-Gradebooks">also available on Github</a>) to make sure you know what it does before running anything. For most users, the only functions to execute are <code>makeStudentSheets()</code> and <code>makeIndividualSpreadsheets()</code>.

					I find it helpful for buy-in and class morale to tell the story of how grades have tended to develop in previous semesters. I use this notebook to generate heatmaps showing how grades build over time. Tallies M grades in a spreadsheet that shares formatting with the <code>AllGrades</code> sheet, and displays them as a heatmap. Made for Julia in a Pluto notebook and available along with instructions for use and example data on <a href="https://github.com/kbroaders/Mastery-Grading-Progress">Github</a>.
